# Java Chess System

## ðŸ¤” About the project

### What?  
This project was created during the classes of Java course by professor Nelio Alves. The exercise proposes the implementation of object-oriented concepts in a chess system.

### Why?
What motivated me the most was to exercise the concepts of object orientation and complex operations with matrices in a project with broad and complex rules. Besides, of course, being a game! I love games and chess was an excellent gateway to game development. 

I will be very happy if you can send any feedback about the project, code, structure or anything else that you have noticed that can make me a better developer!

### The big idea
_"A chess game that runs in any colorful console / terminal"._

### Project State
I feel like the project is done, but by now I'm studying web and mobile development with NodeJS, React and React-Native and I have plans to port this game to a web/mobile version with this new technologies!
